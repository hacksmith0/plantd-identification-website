                        Plumeria obtusa is a small tree, growing 3.0–4.6 m (10–15 ft) tall. Infrequently, individuals can grow to be 7.6 m (25 ft). Its flowers are white with yellow throats and each has five petals. The fragrant flowers bloom in clusters. Leaves are dark green, glossy, and up to 20 cm (8 in) long. They are obovate, or teardrop-shaped. Plumeria obtusa is native to the West Indies (including the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles), southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Florida in the United States.[6][7] Cultivation is common in warmer parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and coastal parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It is reportedly naturalized in China.</div>
